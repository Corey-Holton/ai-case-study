# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: Easymile

* When was the company incorporated: Founded June 2014

* Who are the founders of the company: Easymile was co-founded by CEO Gilbert Gagnaire and Philippe Ligier

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? The co-founders both had a background in autonomous systems and saw a need for for autonomous vehicles. 

* How is the company funded: Private Equity. How much funding have they received: The latest series B raised 66 million in April of 2021 and with previous rounds  of funding over 100 million total since 2014

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? Easymile is focused on reducing traffic congestion, safety and brining cost reductions via operation efficiencies

* Who is the company's intended customer: Entities that deal with public trasport is the major focus. Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers: Nothing specific that I could find, but just one sector of customers in public transportation is 253 billion dollars

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) They have several patents and worlds first, the two largest factors being level 4 autonomy and ISO 9001:2015 Certification

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? This may be the most difficult question to find answers to as I have to date only found topical answers and very little detailed. For perception multiple sensors are used and AI algorithms can process the data and create an understanding of its surrounds, the models can even classify objects into catagoris to include people, other vehicles, or obsticles. The mapping technology Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) uses AI to continually update and improve maps of its environment in near real time. The use of (SLAM) with AI, is what got me interested in this company for this case study. AI is also used in Human-Machine Interface (HMI) although not explicitly named in anything I found online, my assumption is this is a use of Natural language processing as discussed in our class. The company uses AI for other processing like decision making where the automous vehicle can predict the behaviour of other objects such as pedestrians and vehicles, or optimizing routes based on many external imputs such as traffic conditions, road closures, ect. The main two areas AI is used is in control systems and safety in which the AI systems can control driving based on input from multiple sensors, and also monitor for system errors to either corse correct or safely stop to mitigate risks.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in? Autonomous vehicles

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years: With the past 10 years sensor technology greatly imporved autonomous vehicles and propeled the industry to mainstream. But now, AI is paving the way and the increased processing is forcing a revolution in hardware design with chipsets that can handle this increased demand in computing. 

* What are the other major companies in this field? May Mobility, Torc Robotics, Waymo, Gaussin-Mancnica-Mobility and Tesla

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? They have deployed over 300 sites in 30 countries

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics? In autonomous vehicles the core metrics are safety, operational efficiencies, customer satisfaction, economic impact and perfomance metrics.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field? I think this is a hard metric to compare as companies like Waymo and Tesla have very advanced vehicles with millions of miles diven where as easymile has around 620000K miles. The other metrics would in general favor Easymile although on scales considerably smaller than both Tesla and Waymo. It should be noted that Easymile is 100% autonomous and currently being utilized in several deployments world wide. It is noteworthy that easymiles automomous vehicles tend to have less complex tasks as they are not personal vehicles and often run in areas with less obstructions, which may lead to significantly less safety issues compared to others in the space.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer: I would suggest they develop the technology to be deployable with more manufactures and branch out from the current 3 products they have.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? Currently they are focused on creating full soultions using their technology working with a few manufacturers instead of leveraging the technology to work with all manufactures. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? I think the possiblities are limitless and could be used with almost anything that is self propelled and mobile.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? Currenlty most automomous solutions are at a very low level and require much human oversight, the technologies developed and utilized by Easymile could greatly enhance current autonomous robots and pave the way for new and better innovations that will revolutionize the way machines can work for us.
